nothing is better than to learn something by creating it!! Used javascript and objects to implement the basic git
funcitons!

A simple JavaScript simulation of how Git works under the hood — with commits, branches, and HEAD tracking.
You can commit, checkout, and log just like in real Git, but all in pure JS objects.
Built to understand Git’s internal structure in a fun, hands-on way.
